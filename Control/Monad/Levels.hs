-- This library provides an implementation of the MonadPlus type class
-- that enumerates the levels of the search space and allows to
-- implement breadth-first search and iterative deepening depth-first
-- search.
-- 
-- The implementation is inspired by Mike Spivey and Silvija Seres:
-- see Chapter 9 of the book 'The Fun of Programming' and the paper
-- 'Algebras for Combinatorial Search'.
-- 
-- The implementation of breadth-first search is similar to the
-- inspiring implementation but uses lists with constant-time
-- concatenation to represent levels. The implementation of iterative
-- deepening depth-first is simpler than the inspiring implementation
-- thanks to the use of a continuation monad.

-- | The function @bfs@ enumerates the results of a non-deterministic
-- computation using breadth-first search. The implementation does not
-- guarantee that results are returned in any specific order but it
-- does guarantee that every result is eventually enumerated. Due to
-- the large memory requirements of breadth-first search you should
-- use @idfs@ for expensive search.
bfs :: FMList a -> [a]
bfs a = runLevels (unFM a yield)
 where yield x = Levels [singleton x]

-- Non-Deterministic computations of type @Levels a@ can be searched
-- level-wise.
newtype Levels a = Levels { levels :: [FMList a] }

-- Concatenates levels amd yields result as list. 
runLevels :: Levels a -> [a]
runLevels = toList . foldr append empty . levels

instance Semigroup (Levels a) where
  a <> b = Levels (empty : merge (levels a) (levels b))
instance Monoid (Levels a) where
  mempty        = Levels []

-- like 'zipWith append' without cutting the longer list
merge :: [FMList a] -> [FMList a] -> [FMList a]
merge []      ys    = ys

merge (x:xs) (y:ys) = append x y : merge xs ys

-- | The function @idfs@ computes the levels of a depth bound
-- computation using iterative deepening depth-first search. Unlike
-- breadth-first search it runs in constant space but usually takes a
-- bit longer, depending on how the depth limit is increased. Use
-- @idfsBy@ to control this. Don't use this algorithm if you know that
-- there is only a finite number of results because it will continue
-- trying larger depth limits without recognizing that there are no
-- more solutions.  It can, however, produce results lazily: calling
-- @take n . idfs@ terminates if the number of results is larger than
-- @n@.

-- computation using iterative deepening depth-first search
-- incrementing the depth limit between searches using the given
-- number of steps.

-- to iterative deepening search.
